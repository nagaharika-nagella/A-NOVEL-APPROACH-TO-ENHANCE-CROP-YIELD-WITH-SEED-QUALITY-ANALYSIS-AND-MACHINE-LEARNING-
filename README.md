# 🌾 A Novel Approach to Enhance Crop Yield with Seed Quality Analysis and Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview

This project presents a **deep learning–based seed quality assessment system** that classifies soybean seeds into five quality categories — **Intact, Broken, Spotted, Immature, and Skin-Damaged**. The system integrates **DenseNet121** for feature extraction and **InceptionV3** for image classification, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.
By automating the seed grading process, this project aims to **enhance agricultural productivity, ensure sustainable farming**, and minimize human errors in manual inspection.

## 🧩 System Architecture

The proposed system follows a hybrid deep learning pipeline:

1. **Data Acquisition** – 5,513 soybean seed images categorized into 5 quality classes.
2. **Preprocessing** – Image cleaning, resizing (227×227 px), normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Feature Extraction** – Using DenseNet121 (pretrained on ImageNet).
4. **Classification** – Using InceptionV3 for multi-class prediction.
5. **Integration** – Flask backend and web-based frontend for user interaction.
